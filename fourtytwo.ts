// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified

let magicians1: string[] = ["sameer", "yousuf", "rafay"]

function show_magicians1(Magicians1: string[]): void {
    magicians1.forEach(magician1=> console.log(magician1))

}

function make_great(magicians1: string[]): void{
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians1.length; i++){
        magicians1[i]= "the Great " + magicians1[i]
    }
}

//call make_great() the modify to array og magicians
make_great(magicians1)
//call show_magician() to see that the list has actually been modified
show_magicians1(magicians1)
