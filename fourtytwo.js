// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified
var magicians1 = ["sameer", "yousuf", "rafay"];
function show_magicians1(Magicians1) {
    magicians1.forEach(function (magician1) {
        return console.log(magician1);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians1) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians1.length; i++) {
        magicians1[i] = "the Great " + magicians1[i];
    }
}
//call make_great() the modify to array og magicians
make_great(magicians1);
//call show_magician() to see that the list has actually been modified
show_magicians1(magicians1);
